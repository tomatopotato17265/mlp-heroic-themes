# MLP Heroic Themes
This repository is a collection of all of the MLP-inspired themes I have made for [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher).

## Using Themes
First, create a folder in your file manager, and then set it as your theme folder in Heroic. This can be done by navigating to your Settings and entering the path of the folder in the "Custom Themes Path" section. More info can be found on [Heroic's wiki](https://github.com/tomatopotato17265/mlp-heroic-themes/releases).

Next, visit the folder of the theme you would like to download. Download the `.css` file, and save it to the folder you created for your Heroic themes. Finally, select your theme in the dropdown list under "Select Theme".

That's it! Now your local Heroic launcher will have a brand new color scheme inspired by a character from My Little Pony.

## Adding Themes
If you would like to add your own theme, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/tomatopotato17265/mlp-heroic-themes/issues)) containing a high-resolution image of your character (no pixel-art) and your character's cutie mark. If you've already created all or part of the theme already, please share it! The more information you provide, the faster the theme will be published.
