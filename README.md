# MLP Heroic Themes
This repository is a collection of all of the MLP-inspired themes I have made for [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher).

## Using Themes
First, create a folder in your file manager, and then set it as your theme folder in Heroic. This can be done by navigating to your Settings and entering the path of the folder in the "Custom Themes Path" section. More info can be found on [Heroic's wiki](https://github.com/tomatopotato17265/mlp-heroic-themes/releases).

Next, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/tomatopotato17265/mlp-heroic-themes/releases) of this repository; all of the latest themes will be available there. It is _not_ recommended to directly download files from the repository's file system, as all folders will contain both unnecessary and necessary external files. Releases will only download the necessary files to your device. You can choose a theme by scrolling through the folders, however, as those contain screenshots showing how the theme looks.

The majority of themes will replace the main Heroic icon with the cutie mark of the pony that inspired the respective theme. Due to restrictions caused by Electron (the wrapper used by Heroic), the paths of the icons will require the user's _**full path**_. Every theme is formatted to reference the replacement icon in the second line of the `.css` file. Save the full path of the `cutie_mark.svg` to your clipboard and replace the `'cutie_mark.svg'` placeholder with it.

That's it! Now your local Heroic launcher will have a brand new color scheme inspired by a character from My Little Pony.

## Adding Themes
If you would like to add your own theme, please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/tomatopotato17265/mlp-heroic-themes/pulls) containing a high-resolution image of your character (no pixel-art) and your character's cutie mark. If you've already created all or part of the theme already, please share it! The more information you provide, the faster the theme will be published.
